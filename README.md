## üåê Introduction to Project

Planty of Food (POF) is a company that aims to make plant-based food more accessible, especially thanks to its purchasing groups.
My task will be to create RESTful JSON APIs that will allow you to manage these purchasing groups.

### üìã Requirements

The API must allow the insertion, modification and deletion of various entities, including products sold, users records and sales orders. Each of these entities have specific attributes like name's product, name,last name and email of the users and the composition of products and users for each order. Functions will need to be implemented to view all orders, with the possibility of filtering them by date of entry and the products they contain.

The API must follow the REST standards, including naming, the correct use of HTTP methods and good management of response status codes.
We have the flexibility to choose between to using a relational database like MySQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDb to store information.

## ‚ùóInstructions

**1. Clone the repository:**

`git clone https://github.com/lucacucinotta/PlantyOfFoodAPI_node.git`

**2. Install the dependencies:**

`npm install`

**3. Create a .env file:**

Create an account on [MongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/it-it/cloud/atlas/register) or install [MongoDb Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) and create an .env file like this :

```bash
PORT=insert here the port number of your server
DATABASE=insert here the URI of your DB
```

**4. Start the server:**

`npm start`

or, if you prefer to use Nodemon to have a server that updates automatically, type:

`npm run dev`

**5. Test it:**

You can use a client for your test, like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
